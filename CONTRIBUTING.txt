The simplest way to contribute is to spot typos and open an issue
You could also try the bot and see if you encounter any bugs(or typos), if you do please open an issue
You can provide feedback on the bot, it will be appreciated
If you can code in python and know some discord-py:
    -You can fix bugs in preexisting games
    -Contact me and recommend a new game you would like to personally add

Thanks in advanceðŸ˜€!
